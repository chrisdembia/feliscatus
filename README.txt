Getting cats to fall on their feet in OpenSim. The code in this repository was
developed for a course at Stanford University, ME/BIOE 485: Modeling and Simulation
of Human Movement.

The code creates simple rigid-body models of a cat, and employs those models
within an optimization that is trying to learn how to get the cat to flip over
in a forward dynamic simulation.

The `complete` directory contains a refined version of the original code used
to complete the class project.

The `tutorial` directory contains code that has been simplified for use in an
instructional tutorial for aspiring OpenSim users.
